Budget Manager - Expense Monitoring System

 The <i><b>Budget Manager</b></i> application is designed and developed for personal use only, and as part of the completion of my master thesis with title: <br>
 <i><b>  "Affective system monitoring personal expenses, helping the user to stay on budget"</b></i>.
<br>
<ul>
<li>This fully functional prototype system is a mobile friendly web-based interface that helps users track their personal expenses and stay on budget.</li>
<li>The  <i><b>Budget Manager</b></i> application was developed in order to implement and study affective feedback techniques.</li>
<ul>
<br>
